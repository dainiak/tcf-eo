# TCF-EO
[TCF-EO](https://www.dainiak.com/tcf-eo/) is a tool for French learners that allows you 
to generate random question sets for a simulation of the Oral Expression part of the TCF exam.

Selecting multiple tags will filter the questions that contain all the selected tags. 
Selecting no tags is the same as selecting all tags: in this case, no filtering will be applied.
